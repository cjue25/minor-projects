## Intro
Using open datasets to improve the skills of data analysis, including **data wrangling, exploration and visualization**. The practice here are **minor-projects**, other big and formal projects will in different repositories.

## Projects
The projects are ordered by time and named with `P1`, `P2`, etc, where `P` means project.

#### Structures

Each project in general is devided by four parts:
1. **Pre-Processing**: Loading the data and proposing the priori questions to decide the method of cleaning and exploratory direction.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Devided by `Tidiness` and `Quality` part to clean the data.
3. **Exploration and visulization**: Showing the process of exploration and presenting the intersting figures.
4. **Discussion and Conclusions**: Integrating all the observations and giving the meaningful conclusions in the end of analysis. Thus, if the property of the analysis is taking an overview of the relation among the variables, the final achievement of each project will not be emphasized in the brief summary below.
